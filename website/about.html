            <h2>About the project and its authors</h2>

            <p>Continuous Integration, unit and functionnal testings etc... All of these
            subjects are more and more important in Web projects. The success of tools
            like PhantomsJS or CasperJS prove that assertion.</p>

            <p>There is only one issue with PhantomJS: it uses Webkit. Well, sorry,
            we don't say that Webkit is a bad thing. We just want to say that it don't
            give the opportunity for web developpers to do their tests or else with an
            other "web engine", like Gecko for example, the core of Firefox. </p>
            
            <p>After all, Firefox has significant market shares, and so that's a shame to
                run your functional tests only with webkit.</p>

            <p>This is why Laurent Jouanneau started to develop SlimerJS at the end
            of 2012, after a "twitter" discussion with
            <a href="https://twitter.com/n1k0">Nicolas</a>, the author of CasperJS :-).</p>

            <p>Laurent is a long time contributor to the Mozilla Project, starting in 2003
            by opening a web site, <a href="http://xulfr.org">Xulfr.org</a>,
            to promote (in french) Mozilla technologies like XUL. This web site documents
            how to create extension for Firefox or XUL application with XulRunner.
            He has also contributed to Gecko as a C++ developer, in the XUL template
            engine, in the HTML serializer etc. And he worked on many professional
            project using Mozilla technologies.</p>
            
            <p>Laurent continues to involve in the french community of Mozilla, and is
            the co-owner of a <a href="http://innophi.com">little company</a>, which
            provides services around Mozilla technologies, among other things.</p>

            <p>The project does not aims to be a project of a one man. Feel free
            to contribute! SlimerJS is open source, and entirely written in Javascript ;-)</p>
