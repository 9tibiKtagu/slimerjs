For instance, Pitchfork's Ian Cohen writes: "Jay-Z is at least trying to interact with a hip-hop mainstream that has evolved a great deal since his last true solo album, though relegating the production of reigning MVP Mike Will Made It to a one-minute interlude (\"Beach Is Better\") smacks of unintended elitism." Rolling Stone's Simon Vozick-Levinson notes: "He sounds most engaged on \"Jay-Z Blue,\" where he grapples with his deepest fears about parenthood: \"Father never taught me how to be a father, treat a mother/I don't wanna have to just repeat another, leave another/Baby with no daddy.\"" AllMusic's Andy Kellman observes: "Jay-Z is armed with and weighed down by an immense back catalog. Any given track is bound to be compared to a past highlight. The MC indeed can't help sounding more mechanical than novel and, as a 43-year-old referencing Internet memes, he's possibly a little desperate to relate to younger listeners."
 
Ultimately, Jay Z's Magna Carta Holy Grail is an album that divides opinions and sparks debates. Some fans love it, some hate it, and some are indifferent. It is not a flawless masterpiece, but neither is it a complete failure. It is a reflection of Jay Z's status as one of the most influential and successful artists of our time, who has nothing left to prove but still has something to say.
